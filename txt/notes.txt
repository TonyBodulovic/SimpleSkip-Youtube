----------------------------
DONE:

-   Removed promise timeout from individual instances.
    - These are now bundled into promiseElement() functions
    - Default maxwait is 0 (infinite)

-   Removed individual element array management from promise functions.
    - This is now bundled into promiseElement() functions as an index parameter
    - Default parameter is 0

----------------------------
TO-DO:

Refactor code into files
    settingsHelper
    elementPromises

----------------------------
NOTES:

-Unwrapped key elements allows for functions to run when required elements
are already loaded instead of waiting for all elements

-Make element retrieval and creation more modular

(Maybe) Remove last call to timestamp in skip()

Fix recursive skipper
    sets video time to 0 even if video wasnt stopped
    sometimes continues running
    sometimes doesnt skip

Ideas for new ad marker::

document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-exp-ppp-update")[0].getVideoStats()["prerolls"];
Checking video wrapper
If null -> no ad
If "ad" -> ad

wrapper.nextVideo() -> skips to next -> works on ads
Nope! it goes to the NEXT VIDEO it doesnt just skip the ad

-^None of that works these are all functions within youtubes js
they are not publicly accessible only through chrome console which is useless

Need to refactor code into namespaces to avoid any collisions in js
Need to refactor unncessary vars into lets


COLLISIONS DONT HAPPEN!!
Turns out that the content scripts are isolated into "worlds" -> according to
the chrome documentation.

Just need to keep track of global variables now and thats it
